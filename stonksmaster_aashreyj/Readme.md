### Predict Stock Prices using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Features:
1. Uses Sklearn Ensemble model GradientBoostingRegressor for making predictions
2. Model is trained in a single go so that predictions can be made quicker
3. User-friendly GUI to switch between stocks of different companies
4. Readable plots which have actual dates on x-axis instead of timestamp values

#### How to Execute
This should work on a Linux environment using python3:

**Make sure your virtual environment is installed and running**

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
2. `python3 trainer.py` to create binary file dumps of trained models
3. `python3 main.py` to start execution of the GUI, to use the app
